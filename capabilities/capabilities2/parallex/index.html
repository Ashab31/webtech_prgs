        <p>Dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) are domesticated mammals, not natural wild animals. They were originally bred from wolves. They have been bred by humans for a long time, and were the first animals ever to be domesticated. Today, some dogs are used

            be 12 years old before getting their own pet bird. There are, of course, some mature children, who are exceptions to this rule. To help parents judge if their child makes a good pet bird owning candidate,
